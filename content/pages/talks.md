The intent is for conversation, than anything else. 

Here are some talks I've given over the years:

- A geometry of musical chords. Based on the work of Dmitri Tymoczko, for HW0228 Scientific Communication. 2019.
- On the relative absence of “popular mathematics” books: A glimpse into a hidden polemic behind mathematics. Odyssey Research Programme. 29th June 2020
- Creating a researcher's blog/website in Python. Odyssey Research Programme 20th July 2020. 

Here's some supervised/independent work I've done over the years: 

- Piazzolla's Histoire Du Tango: A history of the tango in general or a specific composer. A-level H3 Music 2015.
- To what extent can experimental philosophy contribute to philosophical inquiry. A-level Knowledge and Inquiry 2015.
- On Complexity (2019). Merit prize entry for the inaugural SPMS Writing Competition 2019.
- A dynamical systems approach to the Collatz Conjecture. URECA 19/20.
- Teaching Towards Big Ideas in Mathematics (Secondary). Forthcoming for URECA 20/21.
