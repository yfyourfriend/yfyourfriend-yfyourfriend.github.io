The intent is for conversation, than anything else. 

# Talks
Here are some talks I've given over the years:

- A geometry of musical chords. Based on the work of Dmitri Tymoczko, for HW0228 Scientific Communication. 2019.
- On the relative absence of “popular mathematics” books: A glimpse into a hidden polemic behind mathematics. Odyssey Research Programme. 29th June 2020
- Creating a researcher's blog/website in Python. Odyssey Research Programme 20th July 2020. 

# Work
